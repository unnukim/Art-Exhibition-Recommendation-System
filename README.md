## Experiment
We built a website that gets real-time users’ preference on certain art images as inputs, and returns recommended art
images. The website refers a form of [TindART](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394171.3414445), a visual art recommendation system. When a user access the website, the recommendation results are provided with the following steps.

1. A user is provided with images of artwork sequentially, 20 in total. For each artwork, the user is to choose between ’like’ or ’dislike’ button.
2. After all choices have been made, the user is provided with two artwork recommendation sets; One close to his choice and the other recommended randomly.
3. A user is asked to fill out an online questionnaire to assess his satisfaction level on the recommendations.
